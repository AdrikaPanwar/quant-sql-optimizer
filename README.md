# Quant-SQL Optimizer Project üöÄ

### Overview üß†
The **Quant-SQL Optimizer** is a cutting-edge project that explores the integration of **quantum computing** to optimize SQL queries using the logic behind **Grover's algorithm**. While quantum computing is still in its early stages, this project demonstrates the promising potential of quantum algorithms in real-world applications, particularly in SQL optimization. Built using **Qiskit**, IBM‚Äôs quantum computing framework, this project focuses on the algorithmic logic, bypassing some of the current limitations of quantum simulators like Qiskit Aer.

### Project Journey üîç

The project was developed over the course of a month, exploring how quantum computing principles could interact with SQL query optimization. The results were both challenging and insightful. The core focus of this project was to show how **Grover's algorithm** can work for optimization purposes.

One of the key achievements of the project was its ability to optimize SQL queries based on uploaded datasets. However, there is a notable limitation in its current state:

- **Optimization Limitation**: When a dataset is uploaded, the optimizer transforms the SQL into a **single horizontal line**. While functional, this formatting makes the SQL query difficult to read and interpret, especially for more complex queries that are typically formatted vertically for readability.

- **Quantum Execution Challenges**: Due to issues with Qiskit Aer and the current limitations of quantum computing, the optimizer focuses on the theoretical logic of Grover's algorithm rather than full quantum execution.

Despite these challenges, the project successfully handles both small and large datasets, proving the concept of quantum-assisted optimization.

### Deployment Challenges üöß

As a student developer, I faced several hurdles in deploying this project on common cloud platforms:

- **Heavy Library Requirements**: Due to the size and complexity of the Qiskit library and dependencies, I was unable to deploy this project on platforms like **Vercel** or **Heroku**.
- **Docker Limitations**: While Docker was explored as an alternative, Vercel‚Äôs limitations with larger Docker containers blocked this route as well.
- **Azure Subscription**: I used my free **Azure** subscription during development, but the cost of deploying such a heavy project on cloud services became prohibitive.

For these reasons, the project remains undeployed. However, a **video demonstration** is included in this repository, showcasing its functionality with both small and large datasets.

### Current Status üìä

Although the project isn‚Äôt live, you can explore its logic and implementation:

- A **video demo** is attached to this repository to showcase how the project functions with different datasets.
- A **diagram** is also included to explain how **qubits** are leveraged in the optimization process.

The project is on hold for now, as I shift focus to other areas, but it still offers valuable insights into how quantum computing can be applied to SQL optimization.

### Future Plans üîÆ

I plan to revisit this project once I expand my knowledge in **Machine Learning (ML)**, as ML could potentially enhance the capabilities of quantum algorithms in query optimization. At the moment, my priority is to work on projects related to my portfolio and job placements, but I remain enthusiastic about the future of quantum computing.
